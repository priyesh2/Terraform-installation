# Terraform-installation
Terraform installation script in linux 

This script uses the GitHub API to determine the latest version of Terraform, and then downloads and installs that version. It also installs the unzip utility if it's not already installed.

To use this script, simply save it to a file (e.g., terraform.sh), make it executable with the command chmod +x install_latest_terraform.sh, and then run it with the command sudo ./terraform.sh. Note that you need to have sudo privileges to run this script.
