# Terraform-installation
Terraform installation script in linux

This script downloads and installs the specified version of Terraform for Linux-based systems. It also installs the unzip utility if it's not already installed, since it's needed to extract the Terraform binary from the downloaded ZIP file.

To use this script, simply save it to a file (e.g., terraform.sh), make it executable with the command chmod +x terraform.sh, and then run it with the command sudo ./terraform.sh. Note that you need to have sudo privileges to run this script.
